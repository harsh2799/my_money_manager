This will be an API based project created with various programming technologies:

Backend: Flask using Flask-RESTful to create APIs
Frontend: React JS, HTML, CSS so that we can learn.
DB: We can use NoSQL such as MongoDB.


STEPS:

1) Start with the backend first - creating all the APIs and then start working with the frontend stuff.
	- Create the project folder.
	- Establish the starting of the app and blueprint.
	- Make connection with the database.
2) Use POSTMAN or any API testing tool to test the created APIs.
